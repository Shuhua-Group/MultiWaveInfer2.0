## MultiWaver2.0
MultiWaver series software was designed to infer population admixture history in case of various and complex scenarios. The earlier version of MultiWaver considered only the discrete admixture models. In the newly developed version MultiWaver 2.0, we implemented a more flexible framework to automatically select an optimal admixture model among discrete models and continuous models.

The usage of MultiWaver 2.0 can be found in Manual for MultiWaver 2.0.pdf.
